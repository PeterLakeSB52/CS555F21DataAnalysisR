To do:
Show boxplot of raw response variable & histogram
Show residual plots (y = residuals, x = response variable, use abline to add line for 0)
Show histogram of residuals?
Reasons to remove the outliers: I chose to remove the outliers, in this case the largest values, because my research question is interested in the values closer to 0. 
This improves the statistical significance of my data and avoids outliers overly influencing my regression. 
Consider transformations and at least discuss it in the presentation.
